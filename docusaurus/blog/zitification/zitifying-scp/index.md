# Zitifying SCP

In the [previous post][1] we talked about how we could take a well-known application and improve its security by zitifying it, producing `zssh`. The logical next step after zitifying `ssh` would be to extend the functionality of `zssh` to cover moving files securely as well, enter `zscp`. A zitified `scp` effectively creates a more secure command line tool for sending and receiving files between ziti-empowered devices. Once zitified, we can use `zscp` using ziti identity names just like we did in [zitifying ssh][1]. I recommend reading the [previous article][1]) if you haven't to learn more about the benefits of zitifying tools like `ssh` and `scp`.

* * *

## First Things First

`zscp` functions with the same prerequisites as `zssh`:

* Establish a [Ziti Network][2]
* Create and enroll two Ziti Endpoints (one for our `ssh` server, one for the client)
    * the `sshd` server will run `ziti-tunnel` for this demonstration. Conveniently it will run on the same machine I used to setup the [Ziti Network][3].
    * the client, in this case, is my local machine and I'll `zscp` files both to and from both the remote machine.
* Create the [Ziti Service][4] we'll use and authorize the two endpoints to use this service
* Use the `zscp` binary from the client side and the `ziti-tunnel` binary from the serving side to connect
* Harden `sshd` further by removing port 22 from any internet-based firewall configuration (for example, from within the security-groups wizard in AWS) or by forcing `sshd` to only listen on `localhost/127.0.0.1`

After ensuring these steps are complete, you will have the ability to copy files across your Ziti Network. The traffic will be even more secure since now a Ziti Network is required for the connection, requiring that strong identity before even being able to access the `sshd` server. And of course now `sshd` is 'dark' - it no longer needs the typical port 22 to be exposed to any network.

Given all the prerequisites are satisfied, we can put `zscp` to use. Simply download the binary for your platform:

* [linux][5]
* [windows][6]
* [MacOs][7]

## Sending and Receiving Files with Zscp

Once you have the executable downloaded, make sure it is named `zscp` and for simplicity's sake we'll assume it's on the path. Just like `zssh` to `ssh`, `zscp` provides the same basic functionality as `scp`. As with most tooling, executing the binary with no arguments will display the expected usage.

There are two main functions of `zscp`. Just like `scp` you can send and receive from the remote host.

To send files we use this basic syntax:

```bash
./zscp LOCAL_FILEPATHS... <REMOTE_USERNAME>@TARGET_IDENTITY:REMOTE_FILEPATH
```

Then, to retrieve remote files we use a similar syntax:

```bash
./zscp <REMOTE_USERNAME>@TARGET_IDENTITY:REMOTE_FILEPATH LOCAL_FILEPATH
```

Below is a working example of using `zscp` to send a file to a remote machine. In this case the remote username is not the same as my local username. Just like with `scp`, I'll need to supply the username in my command and it will use the same syntax that regular `scp` uses. Here I am `zscp'ing` as username `ubuntu` to the remote computer that is joined to the Ziti Network using the identity named `ziti-tunnel-aws`.

```bash
./zscp local/1.txt ubuntu@ziti-tunnel-aws:remote
INFO    connection to edge router using token 6c2e8b79-ce8e-483e-a9f8-a930530e706a
INFO    sent file: /Users/name/local/1.txt ==> /home/ubuntu/remote/1.txt
```

This is only a basic example on how we can use `zscp` to send a singular file to a remote computer. In the next section, we will go over how to use `zscp` flags for extended functionality.

* * *

## Zscp Flags

Just like `zssh`, `zscp` has the same flags to pass in: ssh key, ziti configuration file, service name, and one to toggle debug logging. All the defaults are the same as with `zssh`, thus both `zscp` and `zssh` will work without the `-i` and `-c` flag providing the files exist at the default locations. Refer to \[zitifying-ssh\]\[2\] for instructions on how to use the flags below.

```bash
    -i, --SshKeyPath string   Path to ssh key. default: $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
    -c, --ZConfig string      Path to ziti config file. default: $HOME/.ziti/zssh.json
    -d, --debug               pass to enable additional debug information
    -s, --service string      service name. (default "zssh")
```

In addition to the flags above, `zscp` has a flag to enable recursive copying:

```bash
    -r, --recursive           pass to enable recursive file transfer
```

To use the recursive flag, you must input a directory into the `LOCAL_FILEPATH` argument. Just like `scp`, `zscp` will copy all file contents under the provided directory. You can see below how we can use the `-r` flag to send all contents of `big_directory`.

Contents of `big_directory` on local computer:

```bash
tree local
local
└── big_directory
    ├── 1.txt
    ├── 2.txt
    ├── 3.txt
    ├── small_directory1
    │   └── 4.txt
    ├── small_directory2
    │   └── 5.txt
    └── small_directory3
        └── 6.txt
```

Here is the command and output:

```bash
$ zscp -r big_directory ubuntu@ziti-tunnel-aws:remote
INFO    connection to edge router using token d6c268ee-e4f5-4836-bd38-2fc1558257aa
INFO    sent file: /Users/name/local/big_directory/1.txt ==> /home/ubuntu/remote/big_directory/1.txt
INFO    sent file: /Users/name/local/big_directory/2.txt ==> /home/ubuntu/remote/big_directory/2.txt
INFO    sent file: /Users/name/local/big_directory/3.txt ==> /home/ubuntu/remote/big_directory/3.txt
INFO    sent file: /Users/name/local/big_directory/small_directory1/4.txt ==> /home/ubuntu/remote/big_directory/small_directory1/4.txt
INFO    sent file: /Users/name/local/big_directory/small_directory2/5.txt ==> /home/ubuntu/remote/big_directory/small_directory2/5.txt
INFO    sent file: /Users/name/local/big_directory/small_directory3/6.txt ==> /home/ubuntu/remote/big_directory/small_directory3/6.txt
```

After `zssh'ing` to the remote machine, we can prove that all files have been transferred to remote device:

```bash
ubuntu@IP:~$ tree remote/
remote/
└── big_directory
    ├── 1.txt
    ├── 2.txt
    ├── 3.txt
    ├── small_directory1
    │   └── 4.txt
    ├── small_directory2
    │   └── 5.txt
    └── small_directory3
        └── 6.txt
```

Recursive copying also works to retrieve all contents of a directory on the remote machine.

I hope this post has helped you get familiar with another ziti-empowered developer's tool and hopefully it's becoming more clear why zitifying your application will make it more resilient to attack and make the act of connecting to remote services trivial.
